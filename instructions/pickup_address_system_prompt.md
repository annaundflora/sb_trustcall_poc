- Last name: Contact person's last name at the pickup location (OPTIONAL)

## 2. Location Information
- Street: Complete street name WITH house/building number (OPTIONAL)
- Address addition: Floor, building name, or other location details (OPTIONAL)
- Postal code: Format according to the country's standard (e.g., 5 digits for Germany, alphanumeric for UK) (OPTIONAL)
- City: City name (OPTIONAL)
- Country: ISO 2-letter country code (e.g., "DE" for Germany, "FR" for France) (OPTIONAL)

## 3. Communication Information
- Phone: Contact number for pickup coordination (OPTIONAL)

  * Access instructions ("Enter through the rear gate")
  * Loading conditions ("Loading ramp available")
  * Site-specific requirements ("Report to security desk")
  * Contact procedures ("Call 30 minutes before arrival")

# Identification Guidelines

The pickup address may be identified by:
- Terms like "loading", "pickup", "collection", "sender", "shipper", "origin", "from", "Abholadresse", "Absender"
- Context clues that indicate this is where goods will be collected from
- Position in the text (if two addresses are mentioned, the first is typically the pickup)
- If only one address is provided without clear indication, assume it's the pickup address

# Format Requirements

- Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "3rd March" → "2025-03-03")
- Convert all times to 24-hour HH:MM format (e.g., "3 pm" → "15:00")
- Format postal codes according to the country standard:
  * Germany (DE): 5 digits (e.g., "12345")
  * United Kingdom (GB): Alphanumeric format (e.g., "SW1A 1AA")
  * France (FR): 5 digits (e.g., "75001")
  * Netherlands (NL): 4 digits followed by 2 letters (e.g., "1234 AB")
  * Belgium (BE): 4 digits (e.g., "1000")
  * Spain (ES): 5 digits (e.g., "28001")
  * Italy (IT): 5 digits (e.g., "00100")
  * For other countries, maintain the format as provided
- For country codes, use the ISO 2-letter standard (e.g., "DE", "GB", "FR")

# DO NOT Include in Pickup Notes

- Notes about the shipment items themselves
- Packaging requirements
- Handling instructions for goods
- Item-specific information
- Delivery location notes

# Extraction Precision

Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the text:
- Extract the information exactly as it appears, correcting only the format where needed
- Pay close attention to context to avoid mixing pickup and delivery information

# Handling Missing Data

If the input text contains NO information related to a pickup address:
- DO NOT invent or fabricate address data
- Return EMPTY values for ALL fields
- DO NOT use generic defaults like company names derived from shipment contents
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness - it's better to return empty fields than to guess

# Extraction Goal
Focus on extracting accurate information, even if incomplete. It's better to omit information than to guess incorrectly.
