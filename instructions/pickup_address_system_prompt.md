  * Loading conditions ("Loading ramp available")
  * Site-specific requirements ("Report to security desk")
  * Contact procedures ("Call 30 minutes before arrival")
  * GPS Coordinates
  * Trade fair or event-specific access information

- DO NOT include shipment notes, related ot shipment items or handling, such as: 
  * Description of the shipment and shipment items
  * Packaging requirements
  * Handling instructions for the goods
  * Special care needed for fragile items
  * Temperature requirements
  * Hazardous materials information
  * Item-specific loading instructions
  * Product-specific details

# Identification Guidelines

The pickup address may be identified by:
- Terms like "loading", "pickup", "collection", "sender", "shipper", "origin", "from", "Abholadresse", "Absender"
- Context clues that indicate this is where goods will be collected from
- Position in the text (if two addresses are mentioned, the first is typically the pickup)
- If only one address is provided without clear indication, assume it's the pickup address

# Extraction Precision

Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the text:
- Extract the information exactly as it appears, correcting only the format where needed
- Pay close attention to context to avoid mixing pickup and delivery information

# Handling Missing Data

If the input text contains NO information related to a pickup address:
- DO NOT invent or fabricate address data
- Return EMPTY values for ALL fields
- DO NOT use generic defaults like company names derived from shipment contents
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness - it's better to return empty fields than to guess
- Return "null" for missing values

# Extraction Goal
Focus on extracting accurate information, even if incomplete. It's better to omit information than to guess incorrectly.
