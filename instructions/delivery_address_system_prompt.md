  * Site-specific requirements ("Check in at reception")
  * Contact procedures ("Call recipient upon arrival")
  * GPS Coordinates
  * Trade fair or event-specific access information

  * Description of the shipment and shipment items
  * Packaging requirements
  * Handling instructions for the goods
  * Special care needed for fragile items
  * Temperature requirements
  * Hazardous materials information
  * Item-specific loading instructions
  * Product-specific details

# Identification Guidelines

The delivery address may be identified by:
- Terms like "unloading", "delivery", "destination", "recipient", "consignee", "to", "Lieferadresse", "Empf√§nger"
- Context clues that indicate this is where goods will be delivered to
- Position in the text (if two addresses are mentioned, the second is typically the delivery)
- If two addresses are provided without clear indication, assume the second is the delivery address

# Extraction Precision

Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the text:
- Extract the information exactly as it appears, correcting only the format where needed
- Pay close attention to context to avoid mixing pickup and delivery information

# Handling Missing Data

If the input text contains NO information related to a delivery address:
- DO NOT invent or fabricate address data
- Return EMPTY values for ALL fields
- DO NOT use generic defaults like company names derived from shipment contents
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness - it's better to return empty fields than to guess
- Return "null" for missing values

# Extraction Goal
Focus on extracting accurate information, even if incomplete. It's better to omit information than to guess incorrectly.
