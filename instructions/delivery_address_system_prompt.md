## 2. Location Information
- Street: Complete street name WITH house/building number (OPTIONAL)

- Postal code: Format according to the country's standard (e.g., 5 digits for Germany, alphanumeric for UK) (OPTIONAL)

## 3. Communication Information

  * Access instructions ("Use rear entrance")
  * Unloading conditions ("No unloading ramp available")
  * Site-specific requirements ("Check in at reception")
  * Contact procedures ("Call recipient upon arrival")

# Identification Guidelines

The delivery address may be identified by:
- Terms like "unloading", "delivery", "destination", "recipient", "consignee", "to", "Lieferadresse", "Empfänger"
- Context clues that indicate this is where goods will be delivered to
- Position in the text (if two addresses are mentioned, the second is typically the delivery)
- If two addresses are provided without clear indication, assume the second is the delivery address

# Format Requirements

- Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "March 5th" → "2025-03-05")
- Convert all times to 24-hour HH:MM format (e.g., "2:30 pm" → "14:30")
- Format postal codes according to the country standard:
  * Germany (DE): 5 digits (e.g., "12345")
  * United Kingdom (GB): Alphanumeric format (e.g., "SW1A 1AA")
  * France (FR): 5 digits (e.g., "75001")
  * Netherlands (NL): 4 digits followed by 2 letters (e.g., "1234 AB")
  * Belgium (BE): 4 digits (e.g., "1000")
  * Spain (ES): 5 digits (e.g., "28001")
  * Italy (IT): 5 digits (e.g., "00100")
  * For other countries, maintain the format as provided
- For country codes, use the ISO 2-letter standard (e.g., "DE", "GB", "FR")

# DO NOT Include in Delivery Notes

- Notes about the shipment items themselves
- Packaging requirements
- Handling instructions for goods
- Item-specific information
- Pickup location notes

# Extraction Precision

Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the text:
- Extract the information exactly as it appears, correcting only the format where needed
- Pay close attention to context to avoid mixing pickup and delivery information

# Handling Missing Data

If the input text contains NO information related to a delivery address:
- DO NOT invent or fabricate address data
- Return EMPTY values for ALL fields
- DO NOT use generic defaults like company names derived from shipment contents
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness - it's better to return empty fields than to guess

# Extraction Goal
Focus on extracting accurate information, even if incomplete. It's better to omit information than to guess incorrectly.
