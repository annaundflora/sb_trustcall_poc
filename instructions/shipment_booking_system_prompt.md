# Identification Guidelines

## Identifying Pickup Address
The pickup address may be identified by:
- Terms like "loading", "pickup", "collection", "sender", "shipper", "origin", "from", "Abholadresse", "Absender"
- Context clues that indicate this is where goods will be collected from
- Position in the text (if two addresses are mentioned, the first is typically the pickup)

## Identifying Delivery Address
The delivery address may be identified by:
- Terms like "delivery", "unloading", "destination", "ship to", "recipient", "consignee", "to", "Lieferadresse", "Empf√§nger"
- Context clues that indicate this is where goods will be delivered to
- Position in the text (if two addresses are mentioned, the second is typically the delivery)

## Identifying Billing Address
The billing address may be identified by:
- Terms like "invoice", "billing", "bill to", "accounts payable", "payment", "Rechnungsadresse"
- Presence of VAT ID, tax information, or financial references
- Context clues that indicate this is related to payment

## Identifying Shipment Information
Shipment information may be identified by:
- Descriptions of goods, packages, pallets, or cargo
- Measurements (dimensions, weight)
- Quantity information
- Handling instructions

# Extraction Precision

Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the text:
- Extract the information exactly as it appears, correcting only the format where needed
- Pay close attention to context to distinguish between pickup, delivery, and billing information
- For shipment items, categorize each distinct item separately

# Handling Missing Data

If information is missing:
- DO NOT invent or fabricate data
- Return EMPTY values (null) for fields where no information is provided
- DO NOT use generic defaults or assumptions
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness

# Output Format
Return ONLY the structured data in JSON format. Do not include any reasoning or explanations.
